# Fortuna-game

The Fortuna-game needs a good algorithm to create a Fortuna game for their slot machines.
So to test if the game works properly, we will write code for it.

The game uses the currency pix.
# The task
* The player starts with 500 pix
- Game round:
* The player bets pix (at least 50 pix)
* The player chooses a lucky number (1-6)
* Three dice are rolled
* If a dice shows the lucky number, you get to double the bet
* If two dice show, you get the bet three times
* If all the dice show the lucky number, you get the bet four times.

# Rules
* The player may not bet more than he has on the bank
* The player must not cheat and bet negative values
* If the player's account is less than 50 pix, the game ends
* After one round, the player can see his balance and choose whether he wants to run another round
